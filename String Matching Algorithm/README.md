# String Matching Algorithm

String matching algorithms are used to find the occurrence(s) of a pattern (i.e., a substring) in a larger text or string. There are several string matching algorithms available, each with its own advantages and disadvantages, but they all have the same basic goal of efficiently locating the occurrences of the pattern within the text.

One of the simplest string matching algorithms is the brute-force algorithm, which involves comparing each possible substring of the text with the pattern. This algorithm is straightforward to implement but can be quite slow, especially for large texts and patterns.

Other algorithms, such as the Boyer-Moore and Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithms, use pre-processing techniques to skip over portions of the text that cannot contain a match, leading to significant speed improvements. The Rabin-Karp algorithm uses hashing to compare patterns with substrings of the text.

Overall, the choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the problem, such as the size of the text and pattern, the number of queries that need to be made, and the performance requirements.
